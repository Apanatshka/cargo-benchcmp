Compares Rust micro-benchmark results.

Usage:
    cargo benchcmp [options] <old> <new>
    cargo benchcmp [options] <old> <new> <file>
    cargo benchcmp -h | --help
    cargo benchcmp --version

The first version takes two files and compares the common benchmarks.

The second version takes two benchmark name prefixes and one benchmark output
file, and compares the common benchmarks (as determined by comparing the
benchmark names with their prefixes stripped). Benchmarks not matching either
prefix are ignored completely.

If benchmark output is sent on stdin, then the second version is used and the
third file parameter is not needed.

Options:
    -h, --help           Show this help message and exit.
    --version            Show the version.
    --threshold <n>      Show only comparisons with a percentage change greater
                         than this threshold.
    --variance           Show the variance of each benchmark.
    --improvements       Show only improvements.
    --regressions        Show only regressions.
    --color <when>       Show colored rows: never, always or auto [default: auto]
